Getting Started with MetaRelate
********************************

MetaRelate is a project to relate definitions within metadata schemes: it provides guidance on how to interpret a metadata definition from one scheme within another.

Getting started using the information requires the installation of some software, the project does not yet have a live web interface to the relationships.

The project is hosted on Github, at `MetaRelate <https://github.com/metarelate>`_

The metOcean-mapping project uses Python, Django, Jena and Fuseki to provide a repository of translation information, an application programming interface and a user interface.
